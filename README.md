# Exploring-GHG-emission-in-Nigeria

ðŸŒŸ Introduction

The main aim of this work is to analyze emission patterns before, during and after COVID-19. According to Frank Hammes, CEO of IQAir, "The year 2020 brought an unexpected dip in air pollution. I focused on recent years, specifically pre-COVID, COVID, and post-COVID periods, analyzing data from 2015 to 2022.
In 2021, we will likely see an increase in air pollution due to human activity, again. We hope this report will highlight that urgent action is both possible and necessary to combat air pollution, which remains the worldâ€™s greatest environmental health threat."

As mentioned earlier, the main aim is not to compare the two emission inventories but to highlight the differences in their approaches. Additionally, based on the Nigeria National Inventory Report, the values reported are consistent with those of CEDS, confirming that CEDS accurately accounts for and reports the dataset for Nigeria.

I chose CH4 and CO2 because they are among the top emissions with the highest values. I also focused on industrial activities due to their prevalence in areas like Port Harcourt and Lagos, which are known for improper oil drilling and frequent oil spills. These activities significantly affect the local climate, degrade air quality, cause respiratory diseases, and harm plants.

The goal of this study is to provide an impact assessment of emissions on the environment, inform policymakers, and encourage companies to continually engage in or conduct environmental impact assessments of their activities. It also aims to motivate industries to reduce practices contributing to emissions. Together, we can achieve a sustainable environment.
